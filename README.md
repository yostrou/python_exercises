# python_exercises

This repository is a way for me to explore using git as well
as sharing programming problems from edX's *Intro To Python* course.

The course consisted of four classes, which are:

	* Computing in Python I: Fundamentals and Procedural Programming
	* Computing in Python II: Control Structures
	* Computing in Python III: Data Structures
	* Computing in Python IV: Objects & Algorithms
